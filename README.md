# TitanX Gym Management 
TitanX Fitness 360 is a software designed for a gymnasium. It manages customer data in a very easy and intuitive way. There are 2 main users of this software â€“ Receptionists and members of management. The receptionists will use this software to manage customer data and generate invoices. The management will use this software to set standards and generate reports to analyse the customer data. It provides features like dynamic search, email notifications to clients, pdf invoice and report generation.
In gym management, if we take the current system and compare with the proposed one, it lacks certain things like. Every work in the existing system is manual and done on the paper.
These practices are not at all reliable as the one wrong entry can take a lot of time in detection and correction. Humans are prone to errors and mistakes can often be made.
I have introduced a system to reduce the manual work effectively as there is a backend of the system which will take care of synchronizing and updating of the data for the system.
Keeping an automated system is also helps in keeping the client information secure and safe as it can only be seen by the users with the correct credentials which is not an option in the existing system.
